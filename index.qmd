## Pre-Computo era {auto-animate=true}

:::::{.r-stack}
::: {layout-ncol=2 .fragment }

::::{} 
![](img/gutenberg-press.png)
::::

::::{}
The pdf era and paper submission.

The reproducibility was not a priority:

-   difficult to find code, data
-   even methodology details may not be documented
::::

:::

![](img/perplex-scentist.jpg){ .center .fragment width="400"}

:::::


## Pre-Computo era (2)

And then there was distill.pub @olah2017research, an inspiration because:

-   stunning visualizations, for the web and interactive
-   change the scientific publication paradigm, ‚Äúdistillation‚Äù of complex ideas
-   100% reproducible (just a git clone and a few standard commands)

but‚Ä¶

## Pre-Computo era (3)

‚Ä¶ engineering was too complex for the average scientist (a lot of javascript, etc.)

In fact, the distill.pub project was discontinued in 2021 @team2021distill

<!-- Rest in piece image -->

## Pre-Computo era (2)

distill.pub‚Äôs ideas are an ideal, but we need to start from what the scientific community is already using: Rmarkdown, Jupyter notebooks, etc.

\leftarrow and to bring the community to these higher standards,

## Origin (\~ 2020s)

[French statistical society](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/) appoints a "publication" committee (lead by Julien then Pierre) to develop a new journal

::: callout-note
### Assessment

üòî Multiplication of "traditional" journals...

üòî No valorization of "negative" results

üò• No or not enough valorization of source codes and case studies

üò± ‚Üò of publication quality and time dedicated to each article (on author or reviewer sides) [@hanson2023]

üò± Issue with *scientific* reproducibility (analyses, experiments) [@ioannidis2005; @steen2011; @allison2016; @bastian2016; @whitfield2021; @hernandez2023]
:::

::: callout-tip
### Point of view

-   Need for renewal regarding scientific research implementation
-   Need for higher standard regarding result publications
:::

‚áù Emergence of "Computo" idea

## Philosophy

::: callout-note
### Scientific perimeter

Promote contribution in **statistics** and **machine learning** that provide insight into which models or methods are more appropriate to address a specific scientific question
:::

::: callout-tip
### Open access

::: columns
::: {.column width="90%"}
-   ["Diamond" open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Diamond/platinum_OA) (free to publish and free to read, possible to reuse)
-   üÖ≠ üÖØ Content published under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license (attribution, share, adapt)
-   Reviews and discussions available after acceptance for publication (anonymous reviews)

‚áù In accordance with [Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI)](https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/) and [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/addendum-to-the-coalition-s-guidance-on-the-implementation-of-plan-s/principles-and-implementation/)

### Reproducible

-   Numerical (statistical) reproducibility is a necessary condition
-   Source code and data should be available, at least partly executed and fully executable
:::

## Note on reproducible research [@desquilbet2019; @hejblum2020; @the_turing_way2022]

#### Why reproducing scientific results?

-   To strengthen their credibility
-   To check for errors (everyone makes error at some point!!!)
-   To build new research upon them (science is incremental)

#### Issues?

-   Reproduce numerical scientific results is often difficult (technology/environment evolution, source code/environment configuration/software partially available or not available)
-   Waste of time and resources to reproduce existing non-reproducible results

#### Reproducible research?

-   For others but also **for your future self**
-   Improve result credibility
-   Facilitate future research works

## Setup

Official launch at the end of 2021

### "Economical" model

-   A few tenacious people...
-   Free/Open-source community tools (Pandoc, Quarto, Git forge)
-   Institutional support (INRAE, INRIA, CNRS, SFdS)

## Functioning

::: columns

### Writing system

Notebook and literate programming</br><small>text (markdown) + math ($\LaTeX$) + code (Python/R/Julia), references (bib$\TeX$)</small>

### Publication system

Environment management, Compilation, Multi-format publication (pdf, html)<br><small>Continuous integration/Continuous deployment (CI/CD)</small>

### Reviewing system

-   Anonymous exchange published after acceptance
-   Reviewer pool (you can join)
-   \[*Ongoing switch from Scholastica to Open review*\]

## Note on literate programming

<br>

-   Literate programming [@knuth1984]: notebook including text and code
-   Markup formatting language: e.g. [`markdown`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
-   Separate content from rendering (‚â† ["what you see is what you get"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors)
-   Rendering includes text, code and results (from code computations)

<br>

``` markdown
---
title: "My article"
---

We compute 1+1:

\`\`\`{r}
1+1
\`\`\`
```

## Note on quarto

<br>

::: r-stack
[![](img/quarto.png){height="80px"}](https://quarto.org) <https://quarto.org>
:::

<br>

-   Generalization of [`Rmarkdown`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/)
-   Relying on top community tools like universal document converter [`Pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/)
-   Developed and supported by RStudio/Posit
-   Native support of complex documents (website, articles, books) and multiple languages for computations (R, Python, Julia)
-   Management of references, citations, figures, tables, metadata, etc.

## Note on [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

-   Implementation in git forges (e.g. [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [gitlab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/))
-   Triggered by commits
-   Automatic tests
-   Automatic deployment: package/software publication, website

### Step 0: setup a git repository for your article

::: columns
::: {.column width="58%"}
Startup from a template repository ([R](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R), [Python](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-python), [Julia](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-julia))

::: callout-tip
You can host your git repository on [**github**](https://github.com) and soon an any **gitlab** forge[^1].

:::

::: {.column width="42%"}
[![](img/computo_use_template.png)](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-R)
:::
:::

[^1]: with CI/CD support

<br>

### Step 1: write your article

Let's go, locally (same spirit as Jupyter/Rmarkdown notebooks)

## Author point of view (2/3)

### Step 2: configure the environment (dependencies management)

::: panel-tabset
#### Example in Python

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
`venv`: use a virtual environment and generate the `requirements.txt` file
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
``` yaml
# requirements.txt
jupyter
matplotlib
numpy
```
:::
:::

#### Example in R

::: columns
::: {.column width="58%"}
`renv`: generate the `renv.lock` file
:::

::: {.column width="42%"}
``` r
renv::init()
renv::install("ggplot2")
# or equivalently install.packages("ggplot2")
renv::snapshot()
```
:::
:::

#### Example in Julia

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
`Pkg`: native `Julia` package manager (with generated `Project.toml` et `Manifest.toml` files)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
``` julia
add Plots
add IJulia
```
:::
:::
:::

<small>Configuration file versionned and used during CI compilation/publication action</small>

### Step 3: (re)production

A `git push` command will trigger your article compilation (including computations) and publication as a [*github* page](https://pages.github.com)[^2]

[^2]: or as a *gitlab* page when *gitlab* will be supported (soon)

<small>See the preconfigured `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for the *github* action configuration[^3]</small>

[^3]: and soon the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for the *gitlab* CI/CD configuration

## Author point of view (3/3)

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
<br>

### Step 4: submit your article

If the CI process succeeds, both HTML and PDF versions are published on the [*github-page*](https://computorg.github.io/template-computo-R/) associated to the repository

<br/><br/>

#### <s>Scholastica</s> Open review

<https://openreview.net/group?id=Computo>

Submit:

-   your article PDF (scientific content review)
-   your git repository (source code and reproducibility review)

## Editor point of view

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
After a "traditionnal" review process, a 3 step procedure:

1.  Acceptance
2.  Pre-production
3.  Publication in Computo (with a DOI)

including

-   Copy of the author git repository to <https://github.com/computorg/>
-   Final version formatting
-   Review report publication
-   Registration in the journal bibliographic data base
-   Copy of the repository to [Software Heritage](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/search/?q=computorg%2Fpublished&with_visit=true&with_content=true) for archiving

## Discussion

### About several choices

-   [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/): dynamic, agnostic language, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)[^4], community-based ([`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/)), Rstudio/Posit support
-   [`github`](https://github.com): dynamic, large user community but not institutional and limited computing resources

[^4]: "free and open-source"

### Comparison/inspiration

-   [Peer Community-In (PCI)](https://peercommunityin.org/)[^5], [EpiSciences](https://www.episciences.org/): different philosophy and/or functioning
-   <https://rescience.github.io/>: "remake" published articles
-   <https://distill.pub> (discontinued): technically more complicated and only ML/AI oriented

[^5]: Computo is a [PCI-friendly journal](https://peercommunityin.org/pci-friendly-journals/)

## Perspectives

<br>

-   Provision of computing resources (to be able to run all computations)
-   Full *gitlab* support (CI/CD, docker, registry, etc.)
-   Switch to a french institutional gitlab forge?
-   Improve long-term reproducibility stack ([docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, [GUIX](https://guix.gnu.org) fully reproducible environment?)

<br>

# Workshop

## Quarto

In this workshop, we will learn how to use quarto to create a document that includes code, data, and narrative text. We will also learn how to submit our document to Computo.

## Getting started

To get started you will need to clone the mock repository for this workshop. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

## Mock repository

## Creating a repo from a template
