## What is reproducible research?

Fundamentally, it provides three things:

:::: { layout="[[20,80],[20,80],[20,80]]" layout-valign="center"}

![](img/mix.svg){ width="100" }

:::{.fragment}
Tools to reproduce the results (that’s like cooking)
:::


![](img/recipe.svg){ width="100" }

:::{.fragment}
A “recipe” to reproduce the results (still like cooking)
:::

![](img/head-side-thinking.svg){ width="100" height="100" }

:::{.fragment}
A path to understanding the results and the process that led to them (unlike cooking…^[Even so, we may discuss the fact that blindly following recipes will not make you a good cook.])

The pdf era and paper submission.

The reproducibility was not a priority:

- 🛠️ Tools had to be bought, installed, and maintained
- 🔒 Data and code were not shared (social engineering)
- ❓ Even methodology details are often missing
::::

![](img/perplex-scentist.jpg){ .center .fragment width="600"}

:::::

::: {.notes}
Social engineering is required to get reproducible results: at best you just have to ask the authors, at worst you have to reverse-engineer everything… and have no guarantee whatsoever to get to the same results, when authors are in an "Après moi, le déluge" mood and ditch, forget or let it crumble once the paper is published.

### Assessment

- 😔 Multiplication of "traditional" journals...
- 😔 No valorization of "negative" results
- 😥 No or not enough valorization of source codes and case studies
- 😱 ↘ of publication quality and time dedicated to each article (on author or reviewer sides) [@hanson2023]
- 😱 Issue with *scientific* reproducibility (analyses, experiments) [@ioannidis2005; @steen2011; @allison2016; @bastian2016; @whitfield2021; @hernandez2023]

## Note on reproducible research [@desquilbet2019; @hejblum2020; @the_turing_way2022]

#### Why reproduce scientific results?
-   💪 To strengthen their credibility
-   🔍 To check for errors (everyone makes errors at some point!!!)
-   🧱 To build new research upon them (science is incremental)

#### Issues?

-   🔄 Reproduce numerical scientific results is often difficult (technology/environment evolution, source code/environment configuration/software partially available or not available)
-   ⏳💸 Waste of time and resources to reproduce existing non-reproducible results

#### Reproducible research?

-   👥 For others but also **for your future self**
-   ✅ Improve result credibility
-   🚀 Facilitate future research works

## Setup

Official launch at the end of 2021

-   Literate programming [@knuth1984]: notebook including text and code
-   Markup formatting language: e.g. [`markdown`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
-   Separate content from rendering (≠ ["what you see is what you get"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors)
-   Rendering includes text, code and results (from code computations)

<small>See the pre-configured `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for the *github* action configuration[^3]</small>

## Discussion

### About several choices

-   [![](img/quarto.png){height="20px"}](https://quarto.org) **Quarto**: dynamic, agnostic language, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)[^4], community-based ([`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/)), Rstudio/Posit support 🚀
-   [![](img/github-mark.svg){height="20px"}](https://github.com) **GitHub**: dynamic, large user community but not institutional and limited computing resources 🌐

[^4]: "free and open-source"

### Comparison/inspiration

-   [Peer Community-In (PCI)](https://peercommunityin.org/)[^5], [EpiSciences](https://www.episciences.org/): peer review and publication of articles, but not reproducible by default, but we have just built an official community, stay tuned!
-   <https://rescience.github.io/>: "remake" published articles
-   <https://distill.pub> (discontinued): technically more complicated and only ML/AI-oriented

[^5]: Computo is a [PCI-friendly journal](https://peercommunityin.org/pci-friendly-journals/) 

## Perspectives

<br>

-   🖥️ Provision of computing resources (to be able to run all computations)
-   🦊 Full *gitlab* support (CI/CD, docker, registry, etc.)
-   🇫🇷 Switch to a french institutional gitlab forge?
-   🛡️ Improve long-term reproducibility stack ([docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, [GUIX](https://guix.gnu.org) fully reproducible environment, or Containers only at the end of the publication process)

# Reproducibility considerations


![Scientific and editorial reproducibility](figures/reproducible-sequence-orig.svg)


## Two-fold reproducibility

The global scientific workflow of a reproducible process for a Computo may be split into two types of steps:

**External and Editorial**

## External

External
: Process to obtain (intermediate) results utside of the notebook environment, for a list of reasons (non-exclusive to each other):

- 🕰️ the process is too long to be conducted in a notebook
- 💾 the data to be processed is too big to be handled directly in the notebook
- 🖥️ it needs a specific environment (e.g. a cluster, with gpus, etc.)
- 🛠️ it needs to involve specific languages (e.g. C, C++, Fortran, etc.) or build tools (e.g. make, cmake, etc.)

<!-- ## Reproducibility considerations (3)

In our context, **External** is “Computational reproducibility”, where the reproducibility is achieved by providing the code and the environment to run it, but not the results themselves. -->

## Editorial

Editorial
: notebook rendering with the results of the external process

:::{.callout-note title="Requirement"}
If the notebook contains *everything* to produce the final document

$\Rightarrow$ “Direct reproducibility” in the sense that the notebook is the only thing needed to reproduce the results.

Ultimately, the workflow must end with a direct reproducibility step which concludes the whole process.
:::

## Reproducibility considerations (5)

Data transfer
: When applicable, the switch from external to editorial reproducibility is done with a “data transfer” step,

data produced by the external process $\Rightarrow$ transferred to the notebook environment.

:::{.callout-warning title="Requirement"}
Not only the intermediate results are provided, but also **the code to transfer it in the notebook environment.**

There are a variety of software solutions to do so.
:::

## Examples of data transfer solutions

### Intermediate results storage
- 🐍 Python: [`joblib.Memory`](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html), caching mechanism for python functions, save the results of a function call to disk, and load it back later.
- 📦 R : `.RData` file format, can be loaded back in R with the `load()` function.
- 🗃️ If results are small enough, storing them in a text file (e.g. `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.json`, etc.) is also a solution.

### Transfer of the results to the notebook environment
- 📁 (`.joblib` directory or `.Rdata` file) could be committed to the git repository, and directly loaded in the notebook environment.
- ☁️ Alternative, centralize input data (when large enough) and intermediate results on a shared scientific provider (we recommend [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for this purpose), and download them in the notebook environment.

# Workshop

## Quarto

In this workshop, we will learn how to use quarto to create a document that includes code, data, and narrative text. We will also learn how to make the CI (continuous integration) work.

## The main pipeline, step by step

-   🧰 Template installation
-   🧪 computing environment: renv, conda, etc.
-   ✍️ Authoring in the qmd
-   🖨️ rendering locally
-   🚀 pushing to github


## Getting started

To get started you will need to clone the mock template for this workshop. The template is available at

[https://github.com/computorg/jds2025-workshop-template](https://github.com/computorg/jds2025-workshop-template)

:::{ .content-hidden unless-format="revealjs" }
{{< qrcode https://github.com/computorg/jds2025-workshop-template >}}
:::

## Creating a repo from a template

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the file list, click Use this template.
3. Select Create a new repository.

## Cloning the repository
